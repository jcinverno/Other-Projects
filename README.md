# Other-Projects
These are some of the projects I've created while learning and honing my programming skills.

## Graphical-User-Interface
These are some of the GUIs I've built using Object-Oriented Programming and Tkinter.

### State_Of_US: It starts with an empty US map. A message box will appear in which you can enter the name of a state. The state's name will appear on the corresponding state. You must locate all of the states in the United States. You are allowed three incorrect guesses.

### Water_Marking: The application asks for an image, which it then outputs with the text and color you specify.

### Type_Speed_Test: A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed.

### Password_Manager: A Tkinter GUI program that keeps a text file with all of your passwords. It can automatically generate new passwords or provide the written password for a specific login.

## Arcade-Games
These are some of the Games I've built using Object-Oriented Programming and turtle. All of these games feature a scoreboard to track the player's progress, and as the levels advance, the speed of the gameplay becomes progressively faster.

### Snake: A classic video game where the player controls a growing snake and tries to avoid running into obstacles.

### Pong: A simple 2D sports game where players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across a screen.

### Turtle_Crossing: A game where the player controls a turtle and guides it to the other side of the screen while avoiding obstacles, such as bricks.

### Breakout: Classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks at the top of the screen. As the levels progress, the gameplay becomes more challenging with faster ball movement.
